Preprocessed data for the [SLTU experiments](https://www.academia.edu/41986842/Phonemic_Transcription_of_Low-Resource_Languages_To_What_Extent_can_Preprocessing_be_Automated)

There is one directory for each language and speaker we consider. Each directory contains two subdirectories: one with the wav file, the other with the transcriptions. Transcriptions are not segmnented (except for Na).

All data have been extracted from the [Pangloss collection](https://pangloss.cnrs.fr/).
